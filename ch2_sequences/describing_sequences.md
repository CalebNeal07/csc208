# Describing Sequences
- A sequence is  a *ordered* list of numbers
- when represented by variables looks like $a_0,a_1,a_2...$
- We can refer to an entire sequence as $(a_n)_{n\in\N}$
- Sequences are types of functions 
- Any seemingly existing pattern in a sequence cannot be garunteed to exist
- We can describe sequences with a closed formula that finds $a_n$ as a function of $n$
- We can also describe sequences with recursive formulas, a formula that modifies the previous value in the sequence to produce the next value.
- We can modify a know sequence to find the closed formula for another sequence
- Sequences can be the sum of other sequences
- Any sequence can be turned into a new sequences that is the cumulitave sum of every value in the original sequence
- often sigma notaions is used to describe these sequences, e.x. $\displaystyle b_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k$ where $a$ is a sequnce.
- Pi notation can also be used when we want to repeatedly multiply
