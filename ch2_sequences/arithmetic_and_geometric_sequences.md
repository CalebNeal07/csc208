# Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences
 - An arithmetic sequence is a sequence whose terms vary by a constant e.g. $2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...$.
 - A geometric sequence's terms vary by a constant ratio e.g. $2, 6, 18, 54, ...$.
 - We can find the closed form for these sequences by taking the nth term of the sequence and setting it equal to the previous item in the sequence multiplied by a number, $d$ for arithmetic sequences and $r$ for geometric. This gives us an equation that can be solved for the missing variable allowing us to define the sequence.
 - A sequence of partial sums is the sum of the items of a sequence up to $n$. 
 - A good example of this is the triangular numbers: $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...$ which is the sequence of partial sums of the arithmetic sequence $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$.
 - The sum of an arithmetic sequence by summing the first and last values multiplying it by the number of values and halfing the product.
 - For a geometric sequence multiply the last value by the constant ratio and subtract the first value.
