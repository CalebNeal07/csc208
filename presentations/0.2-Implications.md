# Mathimatical Statements - Implications Part 2

## Converse and Contrapositives
$$P\to Q$$
$$Q\to P$$

Converse: If P then Q and if Q then P.

Converses are two independent statements. It is very common for a statements converse to not be true. 

e.x. If it snows then traffic moves slowly ($P \to Q$). If traffic moves slowy then it snows ($Q \to P$).

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \to Q$| $Q \to P$ |
|-----|-----|----------|-----------|
|True |True| True| True |
|True |False| False| True |
|False |True| True| False |
|False |False| True| True |

Contrapositive: If not P then not Q and if not Q the not P.

Same truth table as above, but inverted.

If it snows then traffic moves slowly ($P \to Q$). If it does not snow then traffic moves quickly ($\neg P \to \neg Q$).

## If and Only If

$P \leftrightarrow Q$ means the same as $(P \to Q) \wedge (Q \to P)$\
$P \to Q$ is the `if` part and $Q \to P$ is the `only if` part.

If and only if statements are built of a statement and its converse.

## Necessary and Sufficient

$Q \to P$ - $P$ is neccesary for $Q$\
$P \to Q$ - $P$ is sufficient for $Q$\
$P \leftrightarrow Q$ - $P$ is neccessary and sufficient for $Q$

```
Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and
justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what 
other facts would be enough (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think 
about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true. (Page 14)

## Practice 
Suppose I tell John that if he gets a 68% on his final, then he will fail the class. Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the following cases:
1. John gets a 68% on her final.
2. John gets fails the class.
3. John does not get a 68% on his final.
4. John does not fail the class.
5. None of the above.
