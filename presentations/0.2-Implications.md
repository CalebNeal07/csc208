# Mathimatical Statements - Implications Part 2

## Converse and Contrapositives
$$P\to Q$$
$$Q\to P$$

Converse: If P then Q and if Q then P.

Converses are two independent statements. It is very common for a statements converse to not be true. 

e.x. If it snows then traffic moves slowly ($P \to Q$). If traffic moves slowy then it snows ($Q \to P$).

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \to Q$| $Q \to P$ |
|-----|-----|----------|-----------|
|True |True| True| True |
|True |False| False| True |
|False |True| True| False |
|False |False| True| True |

Contrapositive: If not P then not Q and if not Q the not P.

Same truth table as above, but inverted.

If it snows then traffic moves slowly ($P \to Q$). If it does not snow then traffic moves quickly ($\neg P \to \neg Q$).

## If and Only If

$P \leftrightarrow Q$ means the same as $(P \to Q) \wedge (Q \to P)$

Built of a statement and its converse

## Necessary and Sufficient

$Q \to P$ - $P$ is neccesary for $Q$\
$P \to Q$ - $P$ is sufficient for $Q$\
$P \leftrightarrow Q$ - $P$ is neccessary and sufficient for $Q$

```
Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what other facts would be enough (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true. (Page 14)
