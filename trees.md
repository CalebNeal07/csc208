# Trees

> 11) For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree. Remember, a degree sequence lists out the degrees (number of edges incident to the vertex) of all the vertices in a graph in non-increasing order.

### a) (3, 3, 2, 2, 2)  
The sum of degrees is $3+3+2+2+2=12$  
$$n=5$$
$$2(n-1)=2(5-1)=8$$
$$8\neq 12$$
Thus the degree sequence of a can never be the degree sequence of a tree.

### b) (3, 2, 2, 1, 1)
The sum of degrees is $3+2+2+1+1=9$  
$$n=5$$
$$2(n-1)=2(5-1)=8$$
$$8\neq 9$$
Thus the degree sequence of b can never be the degree sequence of a tree.

### c) (3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1)
The sum of degrees is $3+3+3+1+1+1=12$  
$$n=6$$
$$2(n-1)=2(6-1)=10$$
$$10\neq 12$$
Thus the degree sequence of c can never be the degree sequence of a tree.

### d) (4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
The sum of degrees is $4+4+1+1+1+1+1+1=14$  
$$n=8$$
$$2(n-1)=2(8-1)=14$$
$$14=12$$
Thus the degree sequence of d could possibly be the degree sequence of a tree
