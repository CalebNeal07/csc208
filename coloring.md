# Coloring 

**Coloring is the process of assigning a label, refered to as a color, to elements of a graph.**

### Definitions:
1. **Vertex Coloring**: Assigning a color to each vertex in a graph
2. **Proper**: A vertex is proper if every adjacent vertex are colored differently than the center vertex
3. **CHromatic Number**: The smallest number of unqiue colors that makes every vertex in a graph proper

> [!Note]
> The chromatic number of a graph $G$ is written as $\chi (G)$
